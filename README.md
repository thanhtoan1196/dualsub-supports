Features
--------

* Render as native

  The alternative subtitle will be inserted to the original text as a new line, and set font size a bit smaller.

* Any subtitle source

  You can choose any subtitle source from the player, or use "auto translate" to translate it to another any language.

* Optimized merge algorithm

  Two subtitles never overlay each other, even they have difference time positions.
